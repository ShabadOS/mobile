# {release} ({semver})

Welcome to the {release} release of Shabad OS for Mobile. There are a number of updates we hope you will like, some of the key highlights include:

* <<An actual mobile app!>> - A big thank you to @swissarmykirpan and @Harjot1Singh for laying down the framework of this project
* <<Draggable Drawer>> - Instead of using the traditional iOS tabs bottom bar, we are planning on using a quick shortcuts drawer to manipulate the tab you're on and access app level settings.
* <<Modal Search Action>> - One of these quick shortcuts will be "search" to find the shabad, ang, bani / bookmarks, and maybe someday settings. We hope to evolve this into a truly omni search action.
