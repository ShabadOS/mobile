## Code of Conduct

Expectations for participating in Shabad OS open source communities are similar to other open source communities^<<superscript-microsoft-code-of-conduct,1>>^. Our team and community members are committed to being welcoming, patient, and respectful. People violating this code of conduct may be banned/blocked from the community.

* Be welcoming, for our community is made up of differing backgrounds. Including, but not limited to, race, sex, gender, culture, religion, nation, caste, education, age, politics, and mental/physical ability.
* Be patient, for our community comprises of differing native languages. A welcoming attitude can be more constructive when communicating through someone else's second or third language. This can also apply to programming language!
* Be respectful, for our world-wide community includes many views and perspectives. Professional conduct rarely leads to disrespectful behavior or poor manners, so we strive to conduct ourselves professionally.
* Be understanding, for our project may deal with subjectivities which cannot be analyzed objectively. Our goal is to use disagreements, both social and technical, as learning opportunities. Differences should be resolved as constructively as possible.
* This code of conduct is an example. It serves to capture our goals and intents. If working on Shabad OS projects, then follow the spirit of this code as much as the literal code of conduct.
